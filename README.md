# ðŸŽ® Street Fighter Game (Python + Pygame)

A **2D fighting game** inspired by classic arcade titles, built using **Python** and **Pygame**.  
The project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts while providing a fun, customizable gameplay experience.

---

## Features
- **Two-player fighting mechanics** with health bars and attack logic.
- **Sprite-based animations** for characters.
- **Background music & sound effects** (Dragon Ball Z theme included).
- **Custom backgrounds** for immersive gameplay.
- **Character customization**: swap out sprite images to create your own fighters.
- Modular code using OOP principles:
  - `Game.py` â†’ core game loop
  - `Player1.py` / `Player2.py` â†’ player classes
  - `PlayerHealth.py` â†’ health management
  - `sprite.py` â†’ sprite handling
  - `SplashScreen.py` â†’ intro splash screen

## Customization
- Replace `bg.jpg` or `Splashbg.jpeg` with your own background images.
- Swap character sprites in `Player1.py` and `Player2.py` to use your own fighters.
- Replace the audio file in `assets/` to change background music.
